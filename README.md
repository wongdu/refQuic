# refQuic
want to debug the mvfst project(a quic protocol implemention) with the vs2019 tools on windows10 platform, so generate the *.sln files by cmake-guiï¼Œthen add the dependencies mannually(include directories and libraries)

download the source code to F:\quicNew directory, and open the F:\quicNew\mvfst\vs2019\mvfst.sln file with vs2019,then can debug the quic code.
